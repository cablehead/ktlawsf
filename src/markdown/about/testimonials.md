_“I had the good fortune to work with Alison Kosinski on an employment law issue that was complex. I worked with Alison independently to review a mutual separation agreement. She gave me valuable counsel which led to a fair and gracious exit package. She was extremely knowledgeable, responsive and efficient, and went the extra mile to bring this case to closure. I have already recommended her to others. She is a top notch attorney.”_
