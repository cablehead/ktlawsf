# Updates and Notices to Virgin America Class Members

Dear Class Members:

The following is a report from Class Counsel, the lawyers who represent the Class of Virgin America flight attendants, in _Bernstein et al. v. Virgin America, Inc_.

* The case is presently pending in the federal district court before Judge Jon S. Tigar.  Plaintiffs have prevailed on their claims for overtime, wage statement violations, meal and rest period violations, waiting time penalties, and the failure to pay flight attendants in a timely manner as required by California law.

* The district court has been directed by the appellate court to revise the judgment in accordance with the opinion that the appellate court issued last summer.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have moved to amend the judgment.  Alaska Airlines have made several arguments in opposition.

* The district court has taken off of its calendar its August 18, 2022 hearing, and will decide what the total judgment will be based on the papers submitted by both sides.  Plaintiffs have asked the court to enter a judgment that is approximately $42 million.  Virgin is opposing Plaintiffs’ motion, but agrees that it must pay the Class for the overtime violations.

* Alaska Airlines continues to state that it cannot comply with any obligation to provide meal and rest periods in flight.  To be clear, the ruling in the case was limited: it found Virgin America (and Alaska ONLY as a successor-in-interest to Virgin America) liable for meal and rest periods only for flights within California and only for the time period of March 18, 2011–December 15, 2017.
