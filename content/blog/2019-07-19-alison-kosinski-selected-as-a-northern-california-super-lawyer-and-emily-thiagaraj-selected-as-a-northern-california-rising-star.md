Kosinski + Thiagaraj, LLP congratulates Alison and Emily for their selection to the Northern California Super Lawyer and Rising Star lists!Â  This is Alison's first year as a Super Lawyer and Emily's third consecutive year as a Rising Star.  No more than 5% of lawyers in California are selected as Super Lawyers.  The Rising Stars list is even more selective--it honors 2.5% of the California Bar for their excellence in the legal field.
