# California Supreme Court to Review Whether Security Guards Can Be On-Call During Rest Periods

In February, we reported on the California Court of Appeal case, [_Augustus v. ABM Security Services_](http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/nonpub/B243788.PDF), which permitted employers to place employees on-call during their ten-minute rest breaks.  You can read our analysis of the case [here](http://www.ktlawsf.com/blog/2015/2/2/california-employers-can-require-employees-to-remain-on-call-during-rest-periods).  Now, the Court of Appeal will not have the final word—the California Supreme Court has [granted review](http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2102281&doc_no=S224853) of this decision.

The California Supreme Court will review the lower court’s decision and decide anew whether, according to the California Labor Code and Wage Order 4-2001, employees must be completely relieved of duty, including not being on-call, during their ten-minute rest breaks throughout the day.  The decision will likely come down sometime next year.
