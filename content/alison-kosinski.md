# Alison Kosinski, Partner

> “I love building strong relationships with my clients and working with them
  to reach real solutions.”

Alison represents individuals in all matters related to the workplace.  She
brings to each case a passion and commitment to justice that has been part of
her for years.  After graduating from Cornell University with honors in
Government and Asian Studies, Alison continued her studies in Taiwan, and there
decided to return to her native Boston to attend law school.

> “I went to law school to gain tools to change people’s lives.”

As a law student, Alison represented Chinese-speaking clients in employment and
immigration matters.  Alison went on to graduate suma cum laude from Suffolk University Law School.

> “I learned the ins and outs of all areas of employment law.”

Alison has many years of working in employment law.  She gained invaluable
experience working for four years at a medium-size California law firm that
exclusively practiced employment law.  Alison then co-founded Kosinski and Thiagaraj, LLP in 2014.  She now works with individuals on all types of employment matters, from failure to pay overtime to workplace discrimination to wrongful termination.  Alison brings an open ear and a thoughtful approach to each case.  

> “Being part of a team with my client, representing their interests to my fullest—that’s what I love about being a lawyer.”

Alison volunteers with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and the
AIDS Legal Referral Panel in San Francisco representing immigrants who seek
safety in this country.  Alison obtained asylum and ultimately
permanent residence for a man fleeing persecution in his home country based on
his sexual orientation.  Recently she obtained asylum for a man and his family after he uncovered widespread government corruption in his home country.  Alison now represents an individual who was a victim of violent crime in California seeking lawful status in this country.

> “Giving back to Bay Area residents, whether two- or four-footed, fills my heart.”

While not practicing law, Alison may be seen biking around the Bay Area or
assisting animals in need.  Alison passes her days with
her husband, Andy, their daughters, Nathelina and Annika, and their two cats, Galoshes and
Hop.
