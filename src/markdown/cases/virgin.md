# Updates and Notices to Virgin America Class Members

Dear Class Members:

The following is a report from Class Counsel, the lawyers who represent the Class of Virgin America flight attendants, in _Bernstein et al. v. Virgin America, Inc_.

* The case is presently pending in the federal district court before Judge Jon S. Tigar.  Plaintiffs have prevailed on their claims for overtime, wage statement violations, meal and rest period violations, waiting time penalties, and the failure to pay flight attendants in a timely manner as required by California law.

* The district court has been directed by the appellate court to revise the judgment in accordance with the opinion that the appellate court issued last summer.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have moved to amend the judgment.  Alaska Airlines have made several arguments in opposition.

* The district court has taken off of its calendar its August 18, 2022 hearing, and will decide what the total judgment will be based on the papers submitted by both sides.  Plaintiffs have asked the court to enter a judgment that is approximately $42 million.  Virgin is opposing Plaintiffs’ motion, but agrees that it must pay the Class for the overtime violations.

* Alaska Airlines continues to state that it cannot comply with any obligation to provide meal and rest periods in flight.  To be clear, the ruling in the case was limited: it found Virgin America (and Alaska ONLY as a successor-in-interest to Virgin America) liable for meal and rest periods only for flights within California and only for the time period of March 18, 2011–December 15, 2017.

# Kosinski and Thiagaraj, LLP Wins Over $77 Million on Behalf of Virgin America Flight Attendants for Wage Violations

On March 18, 2015, Kosinski and Thiagaraj, LLP, along with its co-counsel Monique Olivier ([Olivier Schreiber & Chao LLP](http://www.osclegal.com/)), filed a class action lawsuit against Virgin America seeking unpaid minimum and overtime wages.  The lawsuit is brought on behalf of all Virgin America flight attendants who were employed by Virgin America since 2011.  The case is _Bernstein et. al. v. Virgin America, Inc._ (Case No. 15-CV-02277-JST).

The lawsuit, which was brought by two former and one current Virgin America flight attendants, alleges that Virgin America is violating California labor laws by not paying flight attendants for all hours worked (as opposed to just hours in flight), not paying overtime, not providing meal and rest breaks, and not providing accurate wage statements. 

In November 2016, the Court ordered that the class could proceed as a class action.  Click [here](/documents/bernstein-v-virgin-america-order-class-certification.pdf) to read a copy of that order.

Court-approved notice of this lawsuit was sent to Class members in April 2017 to explain the lawsuit and their rights.  More information about this notice is available [here](http://virginwagelawsuit.com/).

In July 2018, the Court issued a series of findings that Virgin America did in fact fail to pay its flight attendants for thousands of hours worked.  The Court then awarded the class of flight attendants a total judgment of over $77 million for these violations.  Click [here](/documents/bernstein-v-virgin-america-order-damages.pdf) to read a copy of the Court's order.  Enforcement of this judgment has been stayed while Virgin [appeals](/documents/bernstein-v-virgin-america-appeal.pdf) this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

If you have any questions about this case, please contact [Alison](/alison-kosinski) at [alison@ktlawsf.com](mailto:alison@ktlawsf.com) or [Emily](/emily-thiagaraj) at [emily@ktlawsf.com](mailto:emily@ktlawsf.com), or both attorneys at 415-230-2860.
